# Escape from IKEA

This is an escape room / puzzle hunt we are running in Jan 2026.

This repository will contain all the HTML assets we need including:
 * A text-based RPG supporting the core of the escape sequence. The text-based RPG is written using [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and [Harlowe](https://twine2.neocities.org/).
 * An audio-based puzzle
